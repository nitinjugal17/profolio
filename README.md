## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How do I change the admin password?**
**A:** Simply change the value of the `CONTENT_UPDATE_PASSWORD` variable in your `.env` file (for local development) or in your hosting provider's environment variable settings (for production).

**Q: The AI features are not working. Why?**
**A:** The AI features require a valid `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from Google AI Studio. Make sure you have added it to your `.env` file or your production environment variables.

**Q: Can I change the website's colors?**
**A:** Yes! The site's color scheme is controlled by HSL CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`. You can edit the `--primary`, `--secondary`, `--background`, and other variables to match your personal brand.

**Q: Where are my uploaded resumes stored?**
**A:** When you upload resume PDFs through the admin panel, they are saved to the `public/` directory of your project (e.g., `public/resume.pdf`). These files are then publicly accessible at `your-site.com/resume.pdf`.
